Some of the elements here won't run on web. Only on android so please install expo go on your android devices or emulators. Make sure your device is connected to the same network as your computer, enable developer mode and usb debugging. If it still doesn't work then run this on your command prompt: `npm run start --tunnel`. Since there are devices that need tunnel enabled to run the project
